# How to use the Alliance Module

Alliance can be integrated into both new and existing blockchains. It is an isolated module that doesnâ€™t modify any existing CosmosSDK code. New blockchains can simply import the module and existing chains can perform a software upgrade.

Chains that want to create an Alliance must enable the following modules:

- [x/auth](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/auth/README.md): retrieve information about internal blockchain accounts
- [x/bank](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/bank/README.md): mint, burn or send coins
- [x/staking](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/staking/README.md): bond, unbond, delegate tokens and hooks
- [x/distribution](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/distribution/README.md): withdraw rewards
- [x/gov](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/gov/README.md): create Alliances through governance

Since Interchain Security is based on the IBC standard, the Alliance module has an indirect dependency on [x/ibc](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go#ibc-go) to bridge foreign tokens. Alliance allows any [ADR 024](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-024-coin-metadata.md#adr-024-coin-metadata) compliant token to be staked as long as it has been whitelisted.
