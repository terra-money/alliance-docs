# Mint an NFT using Terrain 
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that can be showcased, bought, and sold on the blockchain. Purchasing an NFT gives you ownership over the unique digital creation, similar to buying a distinct painting or art piece.
 
In this tutorial, you will learn how to mint your own NFT using the [NFT minting application](https://github.com/terran6/nft-on-terra.git) and LocalTerra.
 
## Prerequisites
 
- [Download Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/)
- [Download the Terra Station extension](../../learn/terra-station/Download/terra-station-extension.mdx)
- [Create a Terra Station wallet](../../learn/terra-station/Download/terra-station-extension.mdx#create-a-wallet)
- [Install npm](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/)
- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Install Terrain](./initial-setup.mdx)
- [Install LocalTerra](./using-terrain-localterra.mdx)

This tutorial utilizes LocalTerra which requires at least 16GB of RAM to run optimally.

## 1. Create your project

After installing all of the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above, use the following steps to set up your environment and clone the [NFT minting repository](https://github.com/terran6/nft-on-terra.git), which contains the NFT minting smart contract and corresponding front end.

<CH.Scrollycoding>

1. Create and enter a new directory for your project.

```sh terminal focus=1:2
mkdir my-nft-project
cd my-nft-project


git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/terran6/nft-on-terra.git


cd nft-on-terra
npm install

```

---

2. Clone the `NFT on Terra` repository to your project directory.

```sh terminal focus=5

```

---

3. Enter the cloned repository and run `npm install` to install all relevant Node dependencies.

```sh terminal focus=8:9

```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

After all the dependencies have been installed, you can close the terminal window.

 
## 2. Start LocalTerra
LocalTerra is a complete Terra testnet and ecosystem containerized with Docker. In this tutorial, you will use LocalTerra to simulate transactions in a local testing environment.
 
After [installing LocalTerra](../localterra/install-localterra.mdx) and all of its dependencies, open a new terminal window and run the following commands.
 
```sh
cd localterra
docker-compose up
```
 
After starting LocalTerra successfully, you should start seeing simulated blockchain transactions.
 
## 3. Set up your wallet
 
In order to use your Terra Station wallet with LocalTerra, you will need to configure your wallet to run on your LocalTerra network.
 
1. Open the Terra Station extension in your Google Chrome web browser. Click the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner and change the network from **mainnet** to  **localterra**.
 
    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/extension_localterra.png" alt="Switch to LocalTerra" />
 
2. Click **Switch wallet**.
 
    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/switch_wallet.png" alt="Switch Wallet" />
 
3. Click **Preconfigured wallets…** and select `test1` from the drop-down list.
 
    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/test_wallet.png" alt="Switch Wallet" />
 
Now that you have successfully switched to the testing wallet on LocalTerra, you will be able to deploy your smart contract.
 
## 4. Update the instantiate message
 
Before you can deploy your contract and begin minting your NFT, you will need to change the `config.terrain.json` file in your cloned repository.
 
1. In your Terra Station extension, open your `test1` wallet and copy the wallet address.
 
    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/copy_address.png" alt="Switch Wallet" />
 
 <CH.Scrollycoding>

2. Open the _`config.terrain.json`_ file in a code editor and locate the instantiate message section.

```json config.terrain.json focus=9:13
      "instantiation": {
        "fee": {
          "gasLimit": 2000000,
          "amount": {
            "uluna": 1000000
          }
        },

        "instantiateMsg": {
          "name":"NFT Collection Name",
          "symbol":"NFTSYMBOL",
          "minter":"terraxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        }

      }
    }
  },
  "mainnet": {
    "_connection": {
      "chainID": "phoenix-1",
      "URL": "https://lcd.terra.dev"
    }
  },
  "testnet": {
    "_connection": {
      "chainID": "pisco-1",
      "URL": "https://pisco-lcd.terra.dev"
    }

```

 ---

3. Update the _`"name"`_ and _`"symbol"`_ fields with the desired name and symbol which will correspond to your NFT collection. The _`"minter"`_ field should be updated with the wallet address of the collection owner, in this case it will be your _`test1`_ wallet address.
 
```json config.terrain.json focus=9:13
      "instantiation": {
        "fee": {
          "gasLimit": 2000000,
          "amount": {
            "uluna": 1000000
          }
        },

        "instantiateMsg": {
          "name":"Cryptocurrency Token NFTs",
          "symbol":"TOKENS",
          "minter":"Paste your test1 wallet address here"
        }

      }
    }
  },
  "mainnet": {
    "_connection": {
      "chainID": "phoenix-1",
      "URL": "https://lcd.terra.dev"
    }
  },
  "testnet": {
    "_connection": {
      "chainID": "pisco-1",
      "URL": "https://pisco-lcd.terra.dev"
    }
    

```

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡">

Be sure to double-check the parameter values in your instantiate message and save the changes to your _`config.terrain.json`_ file before exiting.

## 5. Deploy your contract to LocalTerra
 
You are finally ready to deploy your contract and run the NFT minting application. Make sure you have installed Terrain before proceeding.
 
1. Ensure you are still [running LocalTerra](#2-start-localterra) in a separate terminal window.
 
2. Open a new terminal window and run the following commands to navigate to your cloned repo and deploy your contract using Terrain.
 
   ```
   cd my-nft-project/nft-on-terra
   terrain deploy cw721-metadata-onchain --signer test1
   ```
 
## 6. Launch the app front end
 
Once the contract deployment has successfully completed, you can run the front end application to start minting your NFT.
 
1. Change into the `frontend` directory and install the node dependencies.
 
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
 
2. Start the front end applicaton:
 
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
 
Your chrome browser should open a new window and you should be viewing the front end application at http://localhost:3000/.
 
3. Fill out all of the information on the form to mint your first NFT.
 
- **ID** may be any value that you would like to correspond to the ID of the new NFT.
 
- Enter the **Name** for your NFT.
 
- The **Owner Address** is the wallet address which will be the owner of the newly minted NFT. In this tutorial, this will be your `test1` wallet address.
 
- Use the following **URL** for the NFT image of Luna used in this tutorial.
 
   ```
   https://assets.terra.money/icon/svg/LUNA.png
   ```
 
    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/application.png" alt="NFT Minting Application" />


<Admonition type="note" icon="📝" title="NFT hosting">

Most NFT creators host their NFTs using IPFS (Interplanetary File System). There are a variety of resources available to post an NFT on IPFS, such as [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/). In this example, the image used is available at https://assets.terra.money/icon/svg/LUNA.png.

    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/connect_wallet.png" alt="Connect Wallet" />
 
 
3. Click **Add tokens >** located in the middle of the page to open the contract search window. Paste your contract address in the search bar. Click the **+** button located next to the address of your NFT collection.
 
    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/nft_search.png" alt="Search NFT Collection" />
 
4. Close the search window and you will be presented with information on your NFT collection.
 
    <img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/nft/nft_station.png" alt="NFT Collection" />
 
From here, you can **View** relevant information about your NFT or **Send** your NFT to any specified wallet address.
 
## Congratulations!
 
You've just minted your first NFT on the Terra blockchain! If you have your own unique digital creation that you would like to share with the world, you can follow these instructions using the mainnet network and your personal Terra Station wallet.
