# Terrain initial setup

This tutorial uses a Terra-specific development tool called Terrain.

Terrain will help you:

- Scaffold your dApp project.
- Develop and deploy smart contracts.
- Create custom tasks for blockchain and contract interaction.
- Access a console (or REPL) for interacting with the Terra blockchain.
- Create predefined functions used in tasks and in the console.

## Prerequisites

- [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Install `docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- [Install NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Install Node JS v16](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/)


## Set up Rust

Rust is the main programming language used for CosmWasm smart contracts. While WASM smart contracts can theoretically be written in any programming language, CosmWasm libraries and tooling work best with Rust.

<CH.Scrollycoding>

1. Install the latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash install-rust
Rust installation instructions:

  # link https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
```

---

2. Set 'stable' as the default release channel.

```shellscript rust-set-up focus=1
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

---

3. Add WASM as the compilation target.

```shellscript rust-set-up focus=2

```

---

4. Install a package to run custom cargo scripts.


```shellscript rust-set-up focus=3

```

## Install Terrain

<CH.Scrollycoding>

1. Use npm to install the terrain command-line tool globally.

```shellscript install-terrain
npm install -g @terra-money/terrain
```

---

2. Make sure you are using the latest version of Terrain. Previous versions may cause errors. 

```shellscript install-terrain focus=2
npm install -g @terra-money/terrain
terrain --version
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️" title="Terrain versions">

If you installed a previous version of Terrain, make sure to update it: 

```
npm uninstall -g @iboss/terrain
npm install -g @terra-money/terrain
```

## Next steps: LocalTerra or Testnet

Depending on your setup, you can either [install LocalTerra](./using-terrain-localterra.mdx) or use the [Pisco testnet](./using-terrain-testnet.mdx) to power Terrain.

LocalTerra is a development environment designed to make it easy for smart contract developers to test their contracts locally. Terrain can also interact with the Terra blockchain's live testing environment, the Pisco testnet.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

[Localterra](./using-terrain-localterra.mdx) may not perform optimally on machines with less than 16 GB of RAM. Please use the [Pisco testnet](./using-terrain-testnet.mdx) if your device does not meet this requirement.
