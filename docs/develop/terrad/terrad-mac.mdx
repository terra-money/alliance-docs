# Install Terrad for Mac (Intel or M1)

Terrad is the command-line interface and daemon that connects to Terra and enables you to interact with the Terra blockchain. Terra Core is the official Golang reference implementation of the Terra node software.

This guide is for developers who want to install Terrad and interact with Terra Core without running a full node. If you want to run a full node or join a network, use the documentation on how to [run a full Terra node](../../full-node/run-a-full-terra-node/README.mdx).

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/terra-money/core/tags](https://github.com/terra-money/core/tags) and click on the latest release. 

2. Download the `terra_<latest-version-here>_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` file.

3. Unzip the file in the downloads folder by double clicking on it.

If you are using an Intel-based Mac, proceed to step 4. 

M1 Mac users will need to create `/lib` and `/bin` directories in `/usr/local`:

```sh
sudo cd /usr/local
sudo mkdir lib
sudo mkdir bin
```

4. Navigate to the expanded file in downloads: 
 
```bash
cd Downloads/terra_<downloaded-version>_Darwin_x86_64/
```
 
5. Copy `libwasmvm.dylib` to `/lib`:

```sh
sudo cp libwasmvm.dylib /usr/local/lib
```


6. Add Terrad to your path:

```sh
sudo cp terrad /usr/local/bin
```


7. Start Terrad:

```sh
terrad
```
