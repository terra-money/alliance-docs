# Using Terrad

This guide will go over commands which are available on Terrad, the command-line interface that connects to Terra and enables you to interact with the Terra blockchain. Terrad operates as both a client and a server as every active validator and full node runs Terrad and communicates with their node via Terrad. You can use Terrad to interact with the Terra blockchain by uploading contracts, querying data, managing staking activities, working with governance proposals, and more. For more general information, run `terrad --help` in your terminal. For more information about a specific Terrad command, append the `-h` or `--help` flag after the command: `terrad query --help`.

## Accessing a Node

To query state and send transactions, you must connect to a node, which is the access point to the entire network of peer connections. You can either run your own full node or connect to someone else's.

### Running your own full node

Running your own full node is the most secure option, but it comes with relatively high resource requirements. For more information about the requirements of running your own full node and a tutorial for installing Terrad, check out the [installation guide](../../full-node/run-a-full-terra-node/build-terra-core.mdx). For a tutorial that explains how to connect to an existing Terra network, see [joining a network](../../full-node/run-a-full-terra-node/join-a-network.mdx).

### Connecting to a remote full node

If you don't want to run your own full node, you can connect to someone else's full node. As you consider your options for operators, it is recommended to prioritize operators that you can trust. Malicious operators might intentionally return incorrect query results or censor your transactions. You shouldn't worry about an operator being able to access your account as long as you have your private key stored in a secure location. Possible options of full node operators include validators, wallet providers, or exchanges.

To connect to the full node, you need an address in the `https://<host>:<port>` format, for example `https://77.87.106.33:26657`. This address has to be communicated by the full node operator you choose to trust. You will use this address in the following section.

If you are not running a node and would like to communicate through Terrad, lists of public nodes can be found [here](../endpoints.mdx).

## Configuring Terrad

Terrad enables you to interact with a node that runs on the Terra network, whether you run it yourself or not. To configure Terrad, edit the the `config.toml` file in the `~/.terra/config/` directory.

## Querying Blockchain State

To query all relevant information from the blockchain, such as account balances, amount of bonded tokens, outstanding rewards, and so on, use `terrad query`. The following list shows some of the most useful commands for delegators:

```bash
# query account balances and other account-related information
terrad query account <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
# Account address is of the form terra1rEXAMPLE9tEXAMPLEf9cvEXAMPLEss
# you can find the one for your node by running `terrad keys list`

# query the list of validators
terrad query staking validators

# query the information of a validator given their address
terrad query staking validator <validatorAddress>

# query all delegations made from a delegator given their address
# (note: delegator addresses are regular account addresses)
terrad query staking delegations <delegatorAddress>

# query a specific delegation made from a delegator to a validator
terrad query staking delegation <delegatorAddress> <validatorAddress>

# query the rewards of a delegator given a delegator address (e.g. terra10snjt8dmpr5my0h76xj48ty80uzwhraqalu4eg)
terrad query distr rewards <delegatorAddress>
```

## Sending Transactions

The `terra tx` command can be used to send transactions containing module messages with state-changing directives that get processed and included in blocks.

```bash
terrad tx ...
```

To learn more about the different types of transactions you can issue, see the section for each module.

### Simulating a transaction

To simulate a transaction without actually broadcasting it, append the `--dry-run` flag to the command statement:

```bash
terrad tx bank send \
    <sender_address> \
    <recipient_address> \
    <amount_and_denomination> \
    --chain-id=<chain-id> \
    --dry-run
```

<details> 
<summary> Example: simulate a Luna transfer: </summary>
<p>

```bash
terrad tx bank send \
    terra1ru2ySENDER-EXAMPLEtf9cva9kp33h0jnsm9ss \
    terra1rRECIPIENT-EXAMPLEtf9cva9kp33h0jnsm9ss \
    1uluna \
    --chain-id=pisco-1 \
    --dry-run
```
</p>
</details>

### Generating a transaction without sending

To build a transaction and print its JSON format to STDOUT, append `--generate-only` to the list of the command line arguments. This allows you to separate the creation and signing of a transaction with the broadcasting.

```bash
terrad tx bank send \
    <sender_address> \
    <recipient_address> \
    <amount_and_denomination> \
    --chain-id=<chain-id> \
    --generate-only > unsignedSendTx.json
```

```bash
terrad tx sign \
    --chain-id=<chain_id> \
    --from=<address> \
    unsignedSendTx.json > signedSendTx.json
```
<details> 
<summary> Example: Sign an unsigned transaction </summary>
<p>

```bash
terrad tx sign \
    --chain-id=pisco-1 \
    --from=terra1EXAMPLEy09tEXAMPLEtf9EXAMPLE3h0EXAMPLEss unsignedTx.json
```

A successful transaction response should look similar to the following:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
        "from_address": "terra1ru2ySENDER-EXAMPLEtf9cva9kp33h0jnsm9ss",
        "to_address": "terra1rRECIPIENT-EXAMPLEtf9cva9kp33h0jnsm9ss",
        "amount": [
          {
            "denom": "uluna",
            "amount": "1"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "memo": "",
    "timeout_height": "0",
    "extension_options": [],
    "non_critical_extension_options": []
  },
  "auth_info": {
    "signer_infos": [
      {
        "public_key": {

          "key": "A3Z50zDpCEXAMPLEG5Ru+DGOFEXAMPLEm0EXAMPLEKtxd"
        },
        "mode_info": {
          "single": {
            "mode": "SIGN_MODE_DIRECT"
          }
        },
        "sequence": "0"
      }
    ],
    "fee": {
      "amount": [],
      "gas_limit": "200000",
      "payer": "",
      "granter": ""
    }
  },
  "signatures": [
    "dclBjQ9IsPPkOlcFMsBlQqkx7yqRl0oPBnRuEXAMPLEwlSQTGndiJtZMXI7j5MZ+5JEZI0X3MOg0cr72sq11lA=="
  ]
}
```

You can validate the transaction's signatures by executing the following command:

```bash
terrad tx sign --validate-signatures signedSendTx.json
```

You can broadcast the signed transaction to a node by providing the JSON file to the following command:

```bash
terrad tx broadcast --node=<node> signedSendTx.json
```

## Fees

Transactions on the Terra Protocol network must include a transaction fee in order to be processed. This fee pays for the gas required to run the transaction. To calculate fees, use the following formula:

$$fees = gas * gasPrices$$

The value of `gas` is dependent on the transaction. Different transactions require different amounts of `gas`. The `gas` amount for a transaction is calculated as it is being processed, but there is a way to estimate it beforehand by using the `auto` value for the `gas` flag. Of course, this only gives an estimate. You can adjust this estimate with the flag `--gas-adjustment` \(default `1.0`\) if you want to be sure you provide enough `gas` for the transaction to successfully process.

The `gasPrice` is the price of each unit of `gas`. Each validator sets a `min-gas-price` value and will only include transactions that have a `gasPrice` greater than their `min-gas-price`.

The transaction `fees` are the product of `gas` and `gasPrice`. As a user, you can specify a desired `gasPrice` or `fee` value for a transaction. The higher the value given for `gasPrice` or `fee`, the higher the chance that your transaction will get included in a block.

### Setting Fees

Each transaction may either supply fees or gas prices, but not both. Most users will typically provide fees as this is the final cost you will end up incurring for the transaction being included in the ledger, where as gas prices will be dynamically calculated depending on the validator.

Validators specify a minimum gas price that they use to determine whether or not to include a transaction. The stipulation `gasPrices >= minGasPrices` is checked during the `CheckTx` process. Note, your transaction must supply fees that are greater than or equal to **any** of the denominations the validator requires.

To directly use fees:

```bash
terrad tx send ... --fees=100000uluna
```

If you use fees, validators will calculate the implied `minGasPrices` by dividing your fee with the estimated gas consumption.

To use gas prices:

```bash
terrad tx send ... --gas-prices=0.05uluna
```

### Automatic Fee Estimation

You may want to cap the maximum gas that can be consumed by the transaction via the `--gas` flag. If you pass `--gas=auto`, the gas will be automatically estimated before executing the transaction.

Gas estimates might be inaccurate as state changes could occur in between the end of the simulation and the actual execution of a transaction, thus an adjustment is applied on top of the original estimate in order to ensure the transaction is broadcasted successfully.

The adjustment can be controlled via the `--gas-adjustment` flag, which defaults to the value of 1.0.

To get a direct fee estimation from Terrad:

```bash
terrad tx estimate-fee ...\
    --gas-prices=0.01uluna
    --gas-adjustment=1.4
```

To create and send transactions using fee-estimation, use the template below as a format:

```bash
terrad tx send ... \
    --gas-prices=0.01uluna
    --gas=auto
    --gas-adjustment=1.4
```

## Shell Autocompletion

Auto-completion scripts for popular UNIX shell interpreters such as `bash` and `zsh` can be generated using the `completion` command. This makes interacting with Terra Core endpoints when using the command-line more convenient.

If you want to generate `bash` completion scripts run the following command:

```bash
terrad completion > terrad_completion
```

If you want to generate `zsh` completion scripts run the following command:

```bash
terrad completion --zsh > terrad_completion
```

On most UNIX systems, such scripts may be loaded in `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to enable Bash autocompletion.

```bash
echo '. terrad_completion' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Refer to the user's manual of your operating system's interpreter for information on how to enable shell autocompletion.
