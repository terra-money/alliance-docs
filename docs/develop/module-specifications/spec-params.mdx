# Params

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️">

Terra's params module inherits from the Cosmos SDK's [`params`](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/params/) module. This document is a stub and mainly covers important Terra-specific notes on how it is used.

</Admonition>

The params module provides a base parameter store for all other Terra modules. Structures made with the `params` module are globally available and use subspaces to register specific params to particular modules. The params module defines two types of access: `Keeper` and `Subspace`.

## Params Types

### Keeper

`Keeper` has a permission to access all existing subspaces which are mentioned later on in this document. For example, if a proposal passes through the [governance](./spec-governance.mdx) the `Keeper` can be routed to modified params automatically and according to the proposal.

### Subspaces

`Subspace` is an unique namespace for a paramstore, where keys are configured with a certain prefix. `Subspace` are used by individual keepers, which require an unmodifiable private parameter store.

## Parameters

The genesis parameters for the mint module outlined in the [Genesis Builder Script](https://github.com/terra-money/genesis-tools/blob/main/src/genesis_builder.py#L112) are as follows:
