<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Avoid unnecessary proposals">

To prevent unnecessary proposals or abuse of the system, all governance proposals must obtain a minimum deposit of 512 Luna. If 33.4% of the total vote is `NoWithVeto`, `quorum` is not met, or the minimum deposit isn't reached, the deposit will be burned. All other vote outcomes get their deposits refunded. For more information on deposits and refunds, visit the [governance overview](../protocol.mdx#governance).

Before uploading any proposal, try to get community feedback on [the Terra Agora research forum](https://agora.terra.money).
Do not use text proposals to suggest parameter changes. For more information, visit the [Governance module reference page](../../develop/module-specifications/spec-governance.mdx).
