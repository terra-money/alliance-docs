# Register a validator


This is a detailed step-by-step guide for setting up a Terra validator. Please be aware that while it is easy to set up a rudimentary validating node, running a production-quality validator node with a robust architecture and security features requires an extensive setup.

For more information on setting up a validator, see [additional resources](README.mdx#additional-resources).

## Prerequisites

- You have completed [how to run a full Terra node](../run-a-full-terra-node/README.mdx), which outlines how to install, connect, and configure a node.
- You are familiar with [Terrad](../../develop/terrad/install-terrad.mdx).
- You have read through [the validator FAQ](faq.mdx)
- You understand the [different keys](faq.mdx#validator-keys-and-states) of a validator in the FAQ

## 1. Retrieve your PubKey

The Consensus PubKey of your node is required to create a new validator. Run:

```bash
--pubkey=$(terrad tendermint show-validator)
```

## 2. Create a new validator


<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Get coins">

In order for Terrad to recognize a wallet address it must contain tokens. For the testnet, use [the faucet](https://faucet.terra.money/) to send Luna to your wallet. If you are on mainnet, send funds from an existing wallet. 1-3 luna are sufficient for most setup processes.

</Admonition>

To create the validator and initialize it with a self-delegation, run the following command. `key-name` is the name of the Application Operator Key that is used to sign transactions.

```bash
terrad tx staking create-validator \
    --amount=5000000uluna \
    --pubkey=$(<your-consensus-PubKey>) \
    --moniker="<your-moniker>" \
    --chain-id=<chain_id> \
    --from=<key-name> \
    --commission-rate="0.10" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
    --min-self-delegation="1"
```

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

When you specify commission parameters, the `commission-max-change-rate` is measured as a percentage-point change of the `commission-rate`. For example, a change from 1% to 2% is a 100% rate increase, but the `commission-max-change-rate` is measured as 1%.

</Admonition>

## 3. Confirm your validator is active

If running the following command returns something, your validator is active:

```bash
terrad query tendermint-validator-set | grep "$(terrad tendermint show-validator)"
```

You are looking for the `bech32` encoded `address` in the `~/.terra/config/priv_validator.json` file.

<Admonition type="note" icon="📝">

Only the top 130 validators in voting power are included in the active validator set.

</Admonition>

## 4. Secure your keys and have a backup plan

Protecting and having a contingency backup plan for your [keys](faq.mdx#what-type-of-key-do-i-need-to-use) will help mitigate catastrophic hardware or software failures of the node.
It is a good practice to test your backup plan on a testnet node in case of node failure.
