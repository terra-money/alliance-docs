# Module Parameters

The Alliance module has three parameters set at genesis or following a successful governance proposal. These parameters are critical for a well-functioning integration.

- **RewardDelayTime**

Defines the delay between the time an Alliance is created and the time users can earn rewards for their Alliance delegations.

Types: int64 (`time.Duration` in nanos)

Default: 1 day

- **TakeRateClaimInterval**

Interval of time on each EndBlocker when the module claims the take rate from all Alliance assets with a positive take rate.

Types: int64 (`time.Duration` in nanos)

Default: 5 mins

- **LastTakeRateClaimTime:**

Timestamp of the last successful attempt at claiming the `TakeRate` from Alliance assets. Used to determine when the next TakeRate claim can occur.

Types: int64 (`time.Time` in nanos)

Default: Genesis timestamp

The Alliance module also supports bootstrapping an Alliance-enabled chain by adding the following Alliances to the **assets** list in the genesis file under the **Alliance** property.

### 2.1. AllianceAsset

An Alliance asset consists of the following properties:

```
type AllianceAsset struct {

Denom 			 string

RewardWeight 		 sdk.Dec

TakeRate             sdk.Dec

TotalTokens          sdk.Int

TotalValidatorShares sdk.Dec

RewardStartTime      time.Time

RewardChangeRate	 sdk.Dec

RewardChangeInterval	 time.Duration

}
```

**Denom**

The denomination of the Alliance asset. Assets can be either native or IBC. There can only be  one Alliance asset for a unique denomination.

**RewardWeight**

The voting power weight of an Alliance asset. The native staking coin is assumed to have a reward weight of 1. An alliance asset with a RewardWeight of 0.5 has half the voting power compared to native stakes. Alternatively, a RewardWeight of 5 has five times the voting power. See the voting power section for more information.

**TakeRate**

The rate at which the Alliance asset will be redistributed to all stakers as rewards at every interval determined by the module parameter `TakeRateClaimInterval`.

**TotalTokens**

The total number of Alliance assets that are currently staked.

**TotalValidatorShares**

The total amount of theoretical shares created used to keep track of assets ownership. Similar to share-accounting in the Cosmos x/staking module, this parameter is used to perform “lazy accounting” to reduce computational operations whenever tokens are slashed. See the section on [Delegation and Validator Shares](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_-oDCOIczJcIRByDBcn2y3s0gIGCe5pbPxzSA5y9OGM/edit#heading=h.fm3ckybploma) for more information.

**RewardStartTime**

The time in which the Alliance asset starts to be allocated voting power and rewards. This is used to prevent early stakers from controlling too much of the voting power by providing a warm-up period that allows users to start staking. After this period, rewards and governance power start accruing to Alliance stakers.

**RewardChangeRate**

The rate at which the reward weight is scaled every interval. If the rate is less than 1, the reward weight will tend toward 0.

**RewardChangeInterval**

Every RewardChangeInterval, the reward weight of the asset is scaled according to the RewardDecayRate.
