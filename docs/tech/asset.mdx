# Alliance asset properties

The Alliance module also supports bootstrapping an Alliance-enabled chain by adding the following Alliances to the `assets` list in the genesis file under the `Alliance` property.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Alliance-compatible assets">

The Alliance module leverages the [IBC module](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go#ibc-go) to bridge foreign tokens and the [Token Factory module](https://docs.terra.money/develop/module-specifications/spec-token-factory/) to mint native tokens. Alliance allows any native token recognized by the bank module to be staked as long as it has been whitelisted. CW-20 tokens sent via IBC from other chains can be used in the Alliance module if they are minted as native tokens.

An Alliance asset consists of the following properties:

<CH.Scrollycoding rows="focus">

## Denom

```go AllianceAsset focus=2
type AllianceAsset struct {
    Denom                   string
    RewardWeight            sdk.Dec
    TakeRate                sdk.Dec
    TotalTokens             sdk.Int
    TotalValidatorShares    sdk.Dec
    RewardStartTime         time.Time
    RewardChangeRate	    sdk.Dec
    RewardChangeInterval    time.Duration                              
}

```

The denomination of the Alliance asset. Assets can be either native or IBC. There can only be one Alliance asset for a unique denomination.

---

## RewardWeight

```go AllianceAsset focus=3

```

The reward power weight of an Alliance asset. The native staking coin is assumed to have a reward weight of `1`. An alliance asset with a RewardWeight of `0.5` has half the reward power compared to the native coin. Alternatively, a RewardWeight of `5` will have five times the reward power. See the [reward weight section](../concepts/staking) for more information.

---

## TakeRate

```go AllianceAsset focus=4

```

The rate at which the Alliance asset will be redistributed to all stakers as rewards at every interval, determined by the `TakeRateClaimInterval` module parameter.

---

## TotalTokens

```go AllianceAsset focus=5

```

The total number of Alliance assets that are currently staked.

---

## Total<wbr />Validator<wbr />Shares

```go AllianceAsset focus=6

```

The total amount of theoretical shares created to keep track of asset ownership. Similar to share-accounting in the Cosmos x/staking module, this parameter is used to perform “lazy accounting” to reduce computational operations whenever tokens are slashed. See the section on [Delegation and Validator Shares](../concepts/delegation.mdx) for more information.

---

## Reward<wbr />StartTime

```go AllianceAsset focus=7

```

The time in which the Alliance asset starts to be allocated rewards. This is used to prevent early stakers from controlling too much of the reward power by providing a warm-up period that allows users to start staking. After this period, rewards start accruing to Alliance stakers.

--- 

## Reward<wbr />ChangeRate

```go AllianceAsset focus=8

```

The rate at which the reward weight is scaled every interval. If the rate is less than `1`, the reward weight will tend toward `0`. 

---

## RewardChange<wbr />Interval

```go AllianceAsset focus=9

```

Every `RewardChangeInterval`, the reward weight of the asset is scaled according to the `RewardDecayRate`.
