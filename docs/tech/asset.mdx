# Alliance asset properties

The Alliance module also supports bootstrapping an Alliance-enabled chain by adding the following Alliances to the `assets` list in the genesis file under the `Alliance` property.

An Alliance asset consists of the following properties:

<CH.Scrollycoding rows="focus">

## Denom

```go AllianceAsset focus=2
type AllianceAsset struct {
    Denom                   string
    RewardWeight            sdk.Dec
    TakeRate                sdk.Dec
    TotalTokens             sdk.Int
    TotalValidatorShares    sdk.Dec
    RewardStartTime         time.Time
    RewardChangeRate	    sdk.Dec
    RewardChangeInterval    time.Duration                              
}

```

The denomination of the Alliance asset. Assets can be either native or IBC. There can only be one Alliance asset for a unique denomination.

---

## RewardWeight

```go AllianceAsset focus=3

```

The voting power weight of an Alliance asset. The native staking coin is assumed to have a reward weight of `1`. An alliance asset with a RewardWeight of `0.5` has half the voting power compared to native stakes. Alternatively, a RewardWeight of 5 has five times the voting power. See the [voting power section](../concepts/staking) for more information.

---

## TakeRate

```go AllianceAsset focus=4

```

The rate at which the Alliance asset will be redistributed to all stakers as rewards at every interval determined by the module parameter `TakeRateClaimInterval`.

---

## TotalTokens

```go AllianceAsset focus=5

```

The total number of Alliance assets that are currently staked.

---

## Total<wbr />Validator<wbr />Shares

```go AllianceAsset focus=6

```

The total amount of theoretical shares created used to keep track of assets ownership. Similar to share-accounting in the Cosmos x/staking module, this parameter is used to perform “lazy accounting” to reduce computational operations whenever tokens are slashed. See the section on [Delegation and Validator Shares](../concepts/delegation.mdx) for more information.

---

## Reward<wbr />StartTime

```go AllianceAsset focus=7

```

The time in which the Alliance asset starts to be allocated voting power and rewards. This is used to prevent early stakers from controlling too much of the voting power by providing a warm-up period that allows users to start staking. After this period, rewards and governance power start accruing to Alliance stakers.

--- 

## Reward<wbr />ChangeRate

```go AllianceAsset focus=8

```

The rate at which the reward weight is scaled every interval. If the rate is less than `1`, the reward weight will tend toward `0`. 

---

## RewardChange<wbr />Interval

```go AllianceAsset focus=9

```

Every `RewardChangeInterval`, the reward weight of the asset is scaled according to the `RewardDecayRate`.
