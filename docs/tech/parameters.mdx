# Module Parameters

The Alliance module has three parameters set at genesis or following a successful governance proposal. These parameters are critical for a well-functioning integration.

<CH.Scrollycoding rows="focus">

## RewardDelay<wbr />Time

Defines the delay between the time an Alliance is created and the time users can earn rewards for their Alliance delegations.

```go params.go
RewardDelayTime

Types: int64 (`time.Duration` in nanos)

Default: 1 day
```
---

## TakeRate<wbr />ClaimInterval

The interval of time on each EndBlocker when the module claims the take rate from all Alliance assets with a positive take rate. For more information on the `TakeRate`, visit the [rewards page](../concepts/rewards.mdx). 

```go params.go
TakeRate ClaimInterval

Types: int64 (`time.Duration` in nanos)

Default: 5 mins
```

---

## Last<wbr />TakeRate<wbr />ClaimTime

The timestamp of the last successful attempt at claiming the `TakeRate` from Alliance assets. This timestamp Used to determine when the next TakeRate claim can occur.

```go params.go

Types: int64 (`time.Time` in nanos)

The Alliance module also supports bootstrapping an Alliance-enabled chain by adding Alliances to the [assets list](./asset.mdx) in the genesis file under the `Alliance` property.
