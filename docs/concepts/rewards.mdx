# Reward distribution

## TakeRate

When adding a new Alliance coin, a `TakeRate` can be defined. The `TakeRate` is an annualized tax that redistributes a portion of staked Alliance coin to all stakers on-chain. When paired with an [Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD)](../alliance.mdx#liquid-staking-derivatives), the yield rate of the LSD can be redistributed to all stakers. If the yield rate of the LSD is equal to the Take Rate, the native chain inflation of the LSD is essentially shifted to the chain the LSD is an an Alliance asset on. For a detailed look at the take rate, visit the [How Alliance works](../alliance.mdx#the-take-rate) section. 

The `TakeRate` is defined as a decimal percentage per year. The interval by which this rate is claimed is determined by the module parameter `TakeRateClaimInterval`. When executed, the `TakeRate` amount is deducted from an Alliance assetâ€™s staking pool and deposited into the reward pool, to be distributed to validators and delegators.

For more information on `TakeRate` deductions, visit the [State transitions page](../tech/transitions.mdx#take-rate-deduction). 

## Rewards Distribution

The following is an in-depth look at reward distribution. For general information on rewards, visit the [How Alliance works page](../alliance.mdx#rewards). 

Rewards for staking come from three sources:

- Native inflation: inflation rewards minted by a chain with the x/mint module enabled.
- Transaction fees: gas fees or tax fees that are distributed to validators and delegators.
- TakeRate fees: the annualized redistribution of staked Alliance assets.

These rewards are distributed to stakers using the Cosmos-native x/distribution module. First, rewards are sent to the `fee_collector` module account. During the next begin block event, all rewards are distributed to validators proportional to their [reward power](./staking.mdx#reward-weight). Delegators can then claim their rewards from validators.
