# ♟️ Game of Alliance

# What is Alliance?

**Alliance** is a new tool which allows users to be able to stake their assets cross-chain in Cosmos. The benefits of this include:

1. Being able to maximize rewards by taking advantage of higher returns for certain assets on other chains.
2. Diversifying your portfolio by earning rewards in various tokens.
3. Providing smaller scale blockchains with the ability to attract users and boost interchain security through offering mutually beneficial Alliances.

# What is Game of Alliance?

The **Game of Alliance** is a competition for users to be able to test out the new Alliance module.

Players can learn more about how to utilize Alliance to improve reward potential of their staked assets. Furthermore, players compete by completing tasks or bounties and maximizing their rewards to win various prizes!

# Objectives

1. Request testnet funds from Alliance chains.
2. Strategically delegate, undelegate, and redelegate tokens across multiple chains in order to maximize your rewards and complete [tasks](#tasks).
3. Claim rewards and receive prizes!

# Rules

1. A user must stake their assets on any of the chains in order to qualify for the competition.
2. Scores are only determined from the staking rewards and not the final wallet balances.
3. Automated tools to stake, unstake, and IBC transfer tokens are allowed.
4. Users cannot transfer tokens to other wallets.

# Rewards

1. Possibility of token airdrop from a new Alliance chain which will soon launch on mainnet.
2. Validators who participated in Game of Alliance will have priority in joining the genesis of the new Alliance chain.
3. Bonus bounties to be awarded to builders:
   1. Best alliance visualization
   2. Best scoreboard
   3. Best meme
   4. Best automated staking tooling
4. Accepted bug reports through Github issues.

# Get started!

Navigate to the [Interchain staking with Alliance](./how-to-stake.mdx) tutorial, which will guide you through how to:

1. Request testnet funds from Alliance.
2. Transfer tokens from one chain to another.
3. Stake to an Alliance available on a chain.

The [Undelegating and restaking](./how-to-restake.mdx) tutorial walks you through how to undelegate your stake, transfer the undelegated tokens to another chain, and restake the tokens to take advantage of higher cross-chain rewards.

With this knowledge, you should have a good idea of how to delegate or transfer your tokens across chains and Alliances. Participants will be judged on their task score as well as how well they can strategize their token transfer and cross-chain staking in order to maximize reward potential.

Good luck and have fun!
