# Join the Game of Alliance testnet

## Install Allianced

1. Use `git` to retrieve [Alliance](https://github.com/terra-money/alliance/), and check out the `main` branch, which contains the latest stable release. You can find the latest tag on the [tags page](https://github.com/terra-money/alliance/tags) or via autocomplete in your terminal: type `git checkout v` and press `<TAB>`.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/terra-money/alliance
   cd core
   git checkout [latest version]
   ```

2. Build Alliance. This will install the Allianced executable to your [ `GOPATH` ](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code) environment variable.

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. Verify that Allianced is installed correctly.

   ```bash
   allianced version --long
   ```

**Example**:


   ```
   # First you will see a lot of dependencies
   build_tags: netgo,ledger
   commit: d729f948caf51ffc14187b30391fb27b1cf027ff

   ```

If the `allianced: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that the Go binary path is correctly configured by running the following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
