# Redelegate: same chain

This guide will show you how to use the **Redelegate** feature in the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking) to delegate to a different validator on the same chain. 

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️" title="Redelegating on a different chain">

To redelegate your tokens from one validator to another on a different chain, follow the steps in the [Cross-chain redelegation guide](./cross-chain-redelegating.mdx).

</Admonition>

1. Click the **MANAGE** button next to the validator who you would like to restake to on the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking). This example shows how to redelegate 1 fOSMO from `node1` to `node2`. Be sure to select the proper blockchain and asset which correspond to your stake at the top of the page.
