# Redelegate: same chain

This guide will show you how to use the **Redelegate** feature in the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking) to delegate to a different validator on the same chain. 

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️" title="Redelegating on a different chain">

To redelegate your tokens from one validator to another on a different chain, follow the steps in the [Cross-chain redelegation guide](./cross-chain-redelegating.mdx).

</Admonition>

1. Open the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking) and click the **MANAGE** button next to the validator who you would like to redelegate to. Be sure to select the proper blockchain and asset which correspond to your stake at the top of the page.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Delegating">

Redelegations can only be performed if you have delegated tokens. To learn how to delegate, visit the [Getting started guide](./get-started.mdx).
