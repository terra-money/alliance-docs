#  Redelegate: cross-chain

To delegate an asset to a validator on a different chain, you will need to unstake the delegation, send the assets to the other chain, and delegate to your desired validator. 

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️" title="Redelegating on the same chain">

To redelegate your tokens from one validator to another on the same chain, follow the steps in the [same-chain redelegation guide](./redelegate.mdx).

</Admonition>

Referring to the diagram below, if you want to move from Chain 1 to Chain 3 in testnet, you will first need to transfer tokens from Chain 1 to Terra testnet (Pisco-1) then from Terra testnet (Pisco-1) to Chain 3.

In this example, you will walk through the steps of transferring 1 fOSMO, which will be staked to the Ordos chain, to the Corrino chain.

## Undelegate staked tokens

1. From the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.terra.money/staking) click the **Manage** button next to the validator with which you had originally staked your tokens. Be sure to select the blockchain and asset corresponding to your original stake at the top of the page.

In this example, the current unbonding period is 1 hour. After unbonding begins, you may wish to work on something else while your tokens unbond.

</Admonition>

## Transfer assets across chains

1. Your coins will be undelegated after one hour.  You can use the send function in Station to transfer assets between your addresses on other chains. 

1. Open the Station extension and click **Send**.

Cross-chain transactions may take some time to process. Station may need to be refreshed before you can see your assets. 

</Admonition>

7. Now, you can navigate to the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.terra.money/staking) to delegate. You can refer to the [Delegate tokens to your preferred Alliance](./get-started.mdx#delegate-tokens-to-your-preferred-alliance) section to follow the steps to stake your asset.
