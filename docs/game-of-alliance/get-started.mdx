# Get started: GoA staking

The Game of Alliance is a three-week competition designed to battle-test the Alliance module ahead of its mainnet release. To learn more about the rules of the game, visit the [Overview page](./overview.mdx). In this tutorial, you will learn how to transfer your assets from one chain to another and use those funds in order to stake to a validator on the new chain.

## Create a new Station wallet

1. Follow the [Station extension download guide](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/download/station-extension) to make sure that you have the newest version of the Station extension. 

2. Create a new wallet by following [the wallet creation guide](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/download/station-extension#create-a-wallet). Only new wallets without any transaction history will be eligible to play the Game of Alliance. 

## Switch to the testnet

The Game of Alliance can only be played on the testnet. Follow the next steps to switch your wallet to the testnet network.

1. Open the Station extension in your Chrome browser.

2. Click the gear icon (⚙) in the upper right-hand corner to open the settings menu. 

3. Navigate to the Network tab and select **Testnet** from the network options.

## Request testnet funds from Alliance

The faucet will send you funds so you can start playing. Remember that the faucet can only be used once per wallet address. 

1. Navigate to the [Game of Alliance](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/faucet) faucet.

2. Connect your Station wallet by clicking the **Connect** button in the upper-right corner of the screen.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/connect_wallet.png" />

3. Request all the tokens available on the page. These funds will be transferred to your wallet on the **testnet** network.

Wallets that use the faucet more than once per asset will not be eligible for the Game of Alliance airdrop.

## Transfer assets between chains

Using your Station wallet, you will transfer one of the requested tokens from the prior step, fOSMO, from the Terra chain to the Ordos chain, where an Alliance is available with the tokens you just received.

### Add CW20 tokens

1. To add the CW20 tokens which were requested from the Game of Alliance Faucet, click on the **+ Add tokens** button below the Assets list in your Station extension.

3. To view the coins in your wallet, click the **"+"** button next to the name of the CW20 tokens which you received in the previous step.

Cross-chain transactions may take some time to process. Station may need to be refreshed before you can see your assets.

## Delegate tokens to your preferred Alliance

1. From the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking), select Ordos from the Blockchains in the upper left-hand corner, and select fOSMO from the Alliances in the upper-right. Then, you can click on the **MANAGE** button next to your preferred validator in the Validators list.

<img className="readme-img-lg" src="/img/user-guide/stake_token.png" />

2. In the pop-up window, input the amount of fOSMO that you would like to delegate to the selected validator, and click **DELEGATE**.

3. Finally, sign the transaction from the Station extension pop-up.

Congratulations, you have just formed your first Alliance!

## Claim rewards

Over time, you will start to accrue rewards from the validator to which you had chosen to delegate. Once you earn a sufficient amount of rewards, you can click on the **CLAIM REWARDS** button in the upper right-hand corner of the Validators section to claim them.
