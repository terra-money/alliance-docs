# Redelegating tokens

If you decide that you would like to transfer your tokens from one validator to another, based on possibility for higher rewards for example, you may utilize the `Redelegate` feature in the Game of Alliance.

1. Click the `MANAGE` button next to the validator who you would like to restake to on the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking). In this example, we will be redelegating 1 fOSMO from `node1` to `node2`. Be sure to select the proper blockchain and asset which correspond to your stake at the top of the page.

3. Click on `REDELEGATE` and sign the transaction to complete the redelegation. The process will take 1 hour to be completed.
