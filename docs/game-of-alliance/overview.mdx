# The Game of Alliance

## What is Alliance?

Alliance is an open-source Cosmos SDK module that leverages interchain staking to form economic alliances among blockchains. By boosting the economic activity across Cosmos chains through creating bilateral, mutually beneficial alliances, Alliance aims to give rise to a new wave of innovation, user adoption, and cross-chain collaboration.

To learn about Alliance use cases, see the [Alliance overview](../overview.mdx#use-cases).

## Game of Alliance Overview

The **[Game of Alliance](https://game-of-alliance.terra.money/)** is a three-week incentivized testnet competition designed to battle-test the Alliance module ahead of its mainnet release. Users and validators can complete various [missions](#missions-and-scoring) and [bounties](#bonus-bounties) ‚Äì such as delegating tokens on Game of Alliance chains or creating the best automated staking tool ‚Äì to compete and earn points and prizes.

The competition begins on **Feb. 9th** **and ends at 00:00 UTC on Mar. 2nd**. During this period, parameters, such as staking APRs, Alliance asset take rates, Alliance asset reward rates, and reward rate start times, will regularly change in accordance with the ***Next shuffle time*** shown at the top of the Staking page. When this occurs, players should aim to reallocate their Alliance assets to maximize staking yield, as total staking rewards contribute towards competition scoring.

## Missions and Scoring

There are a total of six missions to complete, each with a corresponding score:

| Score 1-10 | Mission | Instructions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Delegate to any validator using the Alliance module | [Staking guide](./get-started.mdx#delegate-tokens-to-your-preferred-alliance) |
| 1 | Redelegate to any validator using the Alliance module | [Redelegation guide](./redelegate.mdx) |
| 1 | Undelegate from any validator using the Alliance module | [Undelegating guide](./cross-chain-redelegating.mdx#undelegate-staked-tokens) |
| 1 | Claim staking rewards from any chain | [Claim guide](./get-started.mdx#claim-rewards) |
| 3 | Undelegate from one chain, send tokens through IBC, and delegate to a different chain at least ten times | [Cross-chain redelegation guide](./cross-chain-redelegating.mdx) |
| 10 | Run a validator with >80% uptime for more than five days on one of the Alliance chains | [Validator guide](./join-the-testnet.mdx) |

**Note**: Performing the same mission multiple times will not grant a player additional points.

## Rules

The rules of the game are simple:

1. Players must start with a new wallet and fill it with tokens from the **[Faucet](https://game-of-alliance.terra.money/faucet)**.
2. Players must use a single wallet throughout the game.
3. Players must stake tokens on at least one Game of Alliance chain.
4. Automated tools to stake, unstake, and transfer tokens across IBC are allowed.
5. Players cannot transfer tokens to another wallet. Interchain transfers on the same wallet are allowed.
6. To be eligible for rewards, participating validators must submit **[this form](https://terra.sc/goavalidator)** to prove their identities.

## Prizes

Final scores will be calculated using total staking rewards claimed and points earned from completed missions. At the end of the game, players that followed the rules will be eligible for an airdrop from a **soon-to-be-announced Alliance blockchain** based on their score.

Specific details on the chain and airdrop will be released in the near future, so make sure to follow and turn on notifications for **[@terra_money](https://twitter.com/terra_money)** on Twitter!
