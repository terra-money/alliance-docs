# User Guide: Interchain Staking with Alliance

In this tutorial, you will learn how to transfer your assets from one chain to another and use those funds in order to stake to a validator on the new chain.

## Create a new Station wallet

Make sure that you have the newest version of the Station extension and create a new wallet to follow along with this tutorial.

## Switch to testnet

1. Open the Station extension on your browser.

2. Click the settings icon in the upper right-hand corner. In this case, we are using the Station Chrome extension, in which the settings icon is a gear. In the Station desktop or web app, the settings icon is a globe.

3. Navigate to the Network tab and select `Testnet` from the network options.

## Request testnet funds from Alliance

1. Navigate to the [Game of Alliance](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/faucet) faucet.

2. Connect your Station wallet.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/connect_wallet.png" />

3. Request all the tokens available on the page. These funds will be transferred to your wallet on the `testnet` network.

<img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/user-guide/request_tokens.gif" />

## Transfer assets between chains

Using your Station wallet, you will transfer one of the requested tokens from the prior step, fOSMO, from the Terra chain to the Ordos chain, where an Alliance is available with the tokens you just received.

### Add CW20 tokens

1. To add the CW20 tokens which were requested from the Game of Alliance Faucet, click on the `+ Add tokens` button below the Assets list in your Station extension.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/manage_tokens.png" />

3. Next, click the `+` button next to the name of the CW20 tokens which you received in the prior step to be able to view them in your wallet:

- fATOM: terra1qtwuc8atnycww2wz7cu7lh8qd2l50cnhgj3rsvxn72ge0qrxa3es5j6u3c
- fJUNO: terra1du2jfq23hlr8pgevz8cfl0cgu5shqcm5j84zxtpr09qp6psw4lxqhk7505
- fOSMO: terra1ksym7nysy9kx4aq0r7u3nflzxcly9l7gn285vzx9yn0xz3zyd7psd66swt

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/add_tokens.png" />

### Interchain transfer

1. In the Station extension, click on `Transfer`.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/transfer_extension.png" />

2. Fill out all relevant information for the transfer.

   1. Select fOSMO from the `Asset` dropdown list.

   2. Leave Terra selected as the `Source chain`.

   3. Select Ordos as the `Destination chain`.

   4. Enter the number of tokens you would like to transfer in the `Amount` field. In this example, we will transfer 1 fOSMO.

   5. Finally, enter your password and click submit to finalize the transaction.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/transfer_info.png" />

3. After the transaction has been processed, you should see a confirmation like the one below.

<img

  src="/img/user-guide/successful_transaction.png"
/>

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️" title="Wait time">

The transaction will take some time to process and Station may need to be refreshed in order to be able to view the resulting fOSMO on both the Terra and Ordos chains.

</Admonition>

When the transaction has finalized, you should be able to view the fOSMO amounts divided among the Terra and Ordos chains in Station.

## Delegate tokens to your preferred Alliance

1. From the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking), select Ordos from the Blockchains in the upper left-hand corner, and select fOSMO from the Alliances in the upper-right. Then, you can click on the `MANAGE` button next to your preferred validator in the Validators list.

<img className="readme-img-lg" src="/img/user-guide/stake_token.png" />

2. In the pop-up window, input the amount of fOSMO that you would like to delegate to the selected validator, and click on `DELEGATE`.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/delegate.png" />

3. Finally, sign the transaction from the Station extension pop-up.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/sign_transaction.png" />

Congratulations, you have just formed your first Alliance! From here, you will start to accrue rewards from the validator to which you had chosen to delegate. Once you earn a sufficient amount of rewards, you can click on the `CLAIM REWARDS` button in the upper right-hand corner of the Validators section to claim them.

## Undelegating and restaking

If you would like to undelegate your tokens from one alliance and stake them in an alliance on another chain, you will first need to transfer them to Terra. Referring to the diagram below, if we want to move from Chain 1 to Chain 3 in testnet, we will first need to transfer tokens from Chain 1 to Terra (Pisco-1) then from Terra (Pisco-1) to Chain3.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/restaking.png" />

In this example, we will walk through the steps of transferring some fOSMO, which we staked to an Alliance on the Ordos chain in previous steps, to the Alliance chain. From there, you can follow the [Delegate tokens to your preferred Alliance](#delegate-tokens-to-your-preferred-alliance) steps to redelegate to the new chain.

1. From the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking) click the `MANAGE` button next to the validator with which you had originally staked your tokens.

2. Unbond the asset that you want to transfer to another alliance.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/undelegate.png" />

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️" title="Unbonding period">

The current unbonding period is 1 hour. After unbonding, you may wish to work on something else while your tokens unbond.

</Admonition>

3. After waiting one hour, you should transfer that asset to the Terra chain from the origin chain.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/transfer_to_terra.png" />

4. After waiting for the transfer to complete, you can then transfer the amount from the Terra chain to the preferred destination chain. In this case, we will send the 1 fOSMO we received on the Terra chain from the Ordos chain to the Corrino chain.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/transfer_to_corrino.png" />

5. Now, you can navigate to the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking) to delegate. refer to the [Delegate tokens to your preferred Alliance](#delegate-tokens-to-your-preferred-alliance) section to follow the steps to stake your asset.
