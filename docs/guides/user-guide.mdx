# User Guide: Interchain Staking with Alliance

In this tutorial, you will learn how to transfer your assets from one chain to another and use those funds in order to stake to a validator on the new chain.

## Create a new Station wallet

Make sure that you have the newest version of the Station extension and create a new wallet to follow along with this tutorial.

## Switch to testnet

1. Open Station and connect your wallet.

2. Click the settings icon in the upper right-hand corner. In this case, we are using the Station Chrome extension, in which the settings icon is a gear. In the Station desktop or web app, the settings icon is a globe.

3. Navigate to the Network tab and select `Testnet` from the network options.

## Request testnet funds from Alliance

1. Navigate to the [Game of Alliance](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/faucet) faucet.

2. Connect your Station wallet.

3. Request all the tokens available on the page. These funds will be transferred to your wallet on the `testnet` network.

## Transfer assets between chains

Using your Station wallet, you will transfer one of the requested tokens from the prior step, fOSMO, from the Terra chain to the Ordos chain, where an Alliance is available with the tokens you just received.

### Add CW20 tokens

1. For simplicity, navigate to the [Station web application](https://station.terra.money/) and connect your Station wallet.

2. Click on `Manage tokens` next to the `Assets` heading on the right hand side of the page.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/manage_tokens.png" />

3. Add the CW20 tokens which you received in the prior step to be able to view them in your wallet:

- fATOM: terra1qtwuc8atnycww2wz7cu7lh8qd2l50cnhgj3rsvxn72ge0qrxa3es5j6u3c
- fJUNO: terra1du2jfq23hlr8pgevz8cfl0cgu5shqcm5j84zxtpr09qp6psw4lxqhk7505
- fOSMO: terra1ksym7nysy9kx4aq0r7u3nflzxcly9l7gn285vzx9yn0xz3zyd7psd66swt

<img className="readme-img-md" src="/img/user-guide/add_tokens.png" />

### Copy destination chain address

To get the recipient address of the destination chain...

1. Navigate to the Station wallet extension and click on `Receive`.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/station_receive.png" />

2. Copy the address next to the **Ordos** selection. This address will be used in the next step.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/chain_address.png" />

### Transfer tokens

1. In the Station web application, click on `Send`.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/send_extension.png" />

2. Fill out all relevant information for the transfer.

   1. Select fOSMO from the `Asset` dropdown list.

   2. Leave Terra selected as the `Source chain`.

   3. In the `Recipient` field, we can paste the address for the Ordos chain which was copied in the previous step.

   4. Enter the number of tokens you would like to transfer in the `Amount` field. In this example, we will transfer 1 fOSMO.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/send_info.png" />

3. Click on `Submit` and provide your password and click `Post` on the subsequent pop-up in order to transfer our token from the Terra chain to the Ordos chain.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/sign_transaction.png" />

The transaction will take some time to process and the Station web application may need to be refreshed in order to be able to view the resulting fOSMO on both the Terra and Ordos chains.

## Delegate tokens to your preferred Alliance

1. From the [Game of Alliance staking page](https://game-of-alliance.pages.dev/staking?destBlockchain=corrino-1&allianceDenom=ibc%2FD914F9AA87A8AD0FFD1FFC1B050024BDCA43CE726455B9B788C9D5DEDC00876D), select Ordos from the Blockchains in the upper left-hand corner, and select fOSMO from the Alliances in the upper-right. Then, you can click on the `MANAGE` button next to your preferred validator in the Validators list.

<img className="readme-img-lg" src="/img/user-guide/stake_token.png" />

2. In the pop-up window, input the amount of fOSMO that you would like to delegate to the selected validator, and click on `DELEGATE`.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/delegate.png" />

3. Finally, sign the transaction from the Station extension pop-up.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/user-guide/sign_transaction.png" />

Congratulations, you have just formed your first Alliance! From here, you will start to accrue rewards from the validator to which you had chosen to delegate. Once you earn a sufficient amount of rewards, you can click on the `CLAIM REWARDS` button in the upper right-hand corner of the Validators section to claim them.
