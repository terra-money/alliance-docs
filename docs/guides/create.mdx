# Create, update, or delete an Alliance

Transactions that affect Alliances can only be executed via the governance module. All stakers agree on creating, updating, or disbanding Alliances through governance proposals.

## Create an Alliance

<Admonition type="tip" title="Alliance-compatible assets">

The Alliance module leverages the [IBC module](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go#ibc-go) to bridge foreign tokens and the [Token Factory module](https://docs.terra.money/develop/module-specifications/spec-token-factory/) to mint native tokens. Alliance allows any native token recognized by the bank module to be staked as long as it has been whitelisted. CW-20 tokens sent via IBC from other chains can be used in the Alliance module if they are minted as native tokens. 

</Admonition>


Creating an Alliance uses the `/alliance.alliance.MsgCreateAllianceProposal` type. This proposal type describes the `Alliance` attribute with the following properties:

- **`denom`**: The address of the Alliance asset that the community wants to whitelist.
- [**`rewards-weight`**](../concepts/staking.mdx): Specifies the ratio of [reward power](../concepts/staking.mdx#reward-weight) given to each Alliance asset. A chain's native asset assumes a reward weight of 1. 
    - $ratio = \frac{asset\_weight}{sum\_of\_total\_weight}$ 
- **`rewards-weight-min`**: The minimum RewardWeight possible. 
-  **`rewards-weight-max`**: The maximum RewardWeight.
- [**`take-rate`**](../concepts/rewards.mdx): The rate at which the Alliance asset will be redistributed to all stakers as rewards at every interval determined by the `TakeRateClaimInterval` module parameter. Used for liquid staking derivatives.
- **`reward-change-rate`**: The rate at which the reward weight is scaled every interval. If the rate is less than `1`, the reward weight will tend toward `0`. 
- **`reward-change-interval`**: The interval at which the `reward-change-rate` will be applied. 

For more information on Alliance asset properties, visit the [Asset page](../tech/asset.mdx). 

### Usage

```sh tx
allianced tx gov submit-legacy-proposal create-alliance denom rewards-weight rewards-weight-min rewards-weight-max take-rate reward-change-rate reward-change-interval [flags]
```

### Flags

You can add a title, description, and an initial deposit to your proposal by adding the following flags: 

```sh Flags
--from string              Name or address of private key with which to sign
--deposit string           deposit of proposal
--description string       description of proposal
--title string             title of proposal
```

## Update an Alliance

Updating an alliance uses the `/alliance.alliance.MsgUpdateAllianceProposal` type. This action has the same parameters as creating an Alliance. Note that an alliance can be updated only if the parameter `denom` matches a pre-existing Alliance.

### Usage

```sh tx
allianced tx gov submit-legacy-proposal update-alliance denom rewards-weight take-rate reward-change-rate reward-change-interval [flags]
 ```

### Flags

You can add a title, description, and an initial deposit to your proposal by adding the following flags: 

```sh Flags
--from string              Name or address of private key with which to sign
--deposit string           deposit of proposal
--description string       description of proposal
--title string             title of proposal
```

## Delete an Alliance

Deleting an Alliance is of type `/alliance.alliance.MsgDeleteAllianceProposal`. An Alliance cannot be deleted if there are still coins delegated to that Alliance.


<Admonition type="caution" title="Before deleting an Alliance">

The first step in deleting an Alliance is to update the Alliance asset's [`RewardWeight`](../concepts/staking.mdx) to `0`. This will remove all reward power and rewards from the Alliance, effectively removing its influence in the chain.

### Usage

```sh tx
allianced tx gov submit-legacy-proposal delete-alliance denom
```

### Flags

You can add a title, description, and an initial deposit to your proposal by adding the following flags: 

```sh Flags
--from string              Name or address of private key with which to sign
--deposit string           deposit of proposal
--description string       description of proposal
--title string             title of proposal
