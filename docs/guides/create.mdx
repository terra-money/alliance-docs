# Create, update, or delete an Alliance

Transactions that affect Alliances can only be executed via the governance module. All stakers agree on creating, updating, or disbanding Alliances through governance proposals.

### Create an Alliance

Creating an Alliance uses the `/alliance.alliance.MsgCreateAllianceProposal` type. This proposal type describes the `Alliance` attribute with the following properties:

- **Denom**: The address of the Alliance asset that the community wants to whitelist.
- [**RewardWeight**](../concepts/staking.mdx): Specifies the ratio of rewards and voting power given to each Alliance asset. It does not need to sum to 1 (rate = weight / total_weight). 
- [**TakeRate**](../concepts/rewards.mdx): Defines an annualized reward rate that will be redirected to the distribution rewards pool. Used for liquid staking derivatives.
- **Title**: The name of governance proposal.
- **Description**: A description of governance proposal.

**Example**:

```
allianced tx gov submit-legacy-proposal create-alliance ibc/uluna 0.5 0.5 --from=demowallet1
```

### Update an Alliance

Updating an alliance uses the `/alliance.alliance.MsgUpdateAllianceProposal` type. This action has the same parameters as creating an Alliance. Note that an alliance can be updated only if the parameter `denom` matches a pre-existing Alliance.

**Example**:

```
allianced tx gov submit-legacy-proposal update-alliance ibc/uluna 0.1 0.3 --from=demowallet1
```

### Delete an Alliance

Deleting an Alliance is of type `/alliance.alliance.MsgDeleteAllianceProposal`. An Alliance cannot be deleted if there are still coins delegated to that Alliance.


<Admonition type="caution" title="Before deleting an Alliance">

The first step in deleting an Alliance is to update the Alliance asset's [`RewardWeight`](../concepts/staking.mdx) to `0`. This will remove all voting power and rewards from the Alliance, effectively removing its influence in the chain.

**Example**:

```
allianced tx gov submit-legacy-proposal delete-alliance ibc/uluna --from=demowallet1
```
